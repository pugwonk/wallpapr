Before build:

* Remember to build Release (both Setup and WallpaperFlickr)
* Remember to increment BOTH ASSEMBLY AND FILE version on any assemblies that have changed (probably just the one)
* Remember to increment setup version (and do change product code)

Once built, go to Codeplex and click "Downloads...Create New Release"
Name = "Wallpapr 1.6" (or whatever it is)
Add "...\Codeplex Wallpaper Flicker\Setup\Release"
